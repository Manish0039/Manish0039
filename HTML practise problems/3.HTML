   <p> Humour used <b>to be a good defensive mechanism, but as soon as he had become </b> aware it of being a defense mechanism he no longer felt <i>comfortable using it. Better to face up to the facts than employ </i>  a deflective irony. But with nothing with which to deflect, and a now <u> awareness that an honesty about troubles would only be a burden </u> upon the clearly happy and content people around him, he could only remain gravely silent, a furrowed brow christening his chastened pout. </p>
